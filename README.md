### Guess My Number

This is a recreation of the classic Guess My Number game, inspired by the project in <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/" target="blank">The Complete Javascript Course</a>.

## How I Built It

After completing the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/" target="blank">Ultimate React Course</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/" target="blank">HTML & CSS Course</a>, I decided to challenge myself by building this game from scratch using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I recreated the game's functionality and design without directly following the original course instructions, relying on what I learned! ðŸŽ‰
